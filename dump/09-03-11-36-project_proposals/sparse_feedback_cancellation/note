This project seems manageable. It is straight forward in the sense of signal processing and modelling. And it would be interesting to implement adaptive filtering.

CHALLENGES:
    Real-time demands
    sparse adaptive filtering
    matching pursuit


what about automatic modelling? Is that possible?
fx. recording, analyze and model of i.e a rock band. (the proposal is only one instrument/singer)
