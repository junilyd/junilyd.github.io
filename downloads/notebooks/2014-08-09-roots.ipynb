      "However, when we need to define how a computer is suppose to calculate the square root, we can use numerical methods. (insert link here). I finished my B.Sc.EE project this semster. The project theme was embedded signal processing with the design and implementation of a GFSK-Demodulator, for satellite communication, in a fixed point DSP. Therefore, I came across several interesting algorithms for approximation of the square root in fixed point arithmetic. I believe this is an obvious subject for first blog post here, where I will demonstrate these in Python, starting with Newtons Method.\n",
