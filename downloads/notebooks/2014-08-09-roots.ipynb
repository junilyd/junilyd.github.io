      "Since it sometimes is required to calculate the square root of some number. This job seems actually quite easy by simply solving the equation for the square root of 2. $$x^2 - 2 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = \\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.41$$. However, when we need to define how a simple computer is suppose to calculate the square root numerically, we can use a numerical method. (insert link here) i.e Newtons Method. In my B.Sc project, this semester, was in embedded signal processing, designing and implenting a GFSK-Demodualtor in a fixed point DSP. Therefore, I came across some interesting numerical algorithms for all kinds of signal processing algorithms. It is often necessary to calculate the length of a complex vector, which yields a calculation of the square root. In the following some approximation algorithms, will lead to an example of a fixed point numerical calculation. This I thought is an obvious subject for my first blog post. "
