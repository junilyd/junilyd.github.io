      "Since it sometimes is required to calculate the square root of some number. This job is straight forward by solving the 2nd order equation for the square root of 2 i.e. $$ x^2 \u2212 2 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = \\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.41$$ \n",
      "However, when we need to define how a computer is suppose to calculate the square root, we can use numerical methods. (insert link here). In my B.Sc project which was in embedded signal processing, emdbedding in a fixed point DSP. Therefore I came across some interesting algorithms for implementing such an algorithm in fixed point arithmetic. This is obvious subject for first blog post here."
