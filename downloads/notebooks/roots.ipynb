      "However, when we need to define how a computer is suppose to calculate the square root, we can use numerical methods. I finished my B.Sc.EE project this semster. The project theme was Embedded Signal Processing with the design and implementation of a GFSK-Demodulator for Satellite Communication, in a fixed point DSP. For the design it was necessary to calculate the Magnitude $M$ of a complex number $I + jQ$ which is defined as $M = \\sqrt{I^2 + Q^2}$. Therefore, I came across several interesting algorithms for approximation of the square root in fixed point arithmetic. I believe this is an obvious subject for first blog post here, where I will demonstrate these in Python, starting with Newtons Method.\n",
