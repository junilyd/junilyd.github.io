    <h2>Who is Jacob Møller</h2>
    <p>In the year of 1982 I came into this world. </p>

    <p>2014 is also the year of which I graduated my Bachelor of science in engineering. I will continue with an M.Sc.EE in Sound & Music Computing.</p>
    <p>In the period 1997-2005 I did almost nothing but play music in various rock bands apart from working sometimes as a sound engineer.</p>
    <p>2005 is the year I started dating my girlfriend Lærke.</p>
    <p>2006 is where my first born daughter Johanne came in to this world. She was followed by here sister Maja in 2009. 2006 is also the year my mother passed away</p>
    <p>From 2007 I started working as a sound engineer as a day job, doing various concerts and other events. Which now has led me to become an electrical engineer.</p>
